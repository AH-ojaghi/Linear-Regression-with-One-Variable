# 📈 Linear Regression with One Variable

This project implements **Linear Regression with One Variable** using Python and NumPy. It is an introductory machine learning model that demonstrates how a line of best fit can be used to predict outcomes based on a single feature.

## 🧠 Objective

To understand and implement the basic concepts of linear regression, gradient descent optimization, and cost function evaluation on a simple dataset.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to load and visualize data
- The concept of hypothesis function (hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x)
- Cost function (Mean Squared Error)
- Gradient descent algorithm
- Plotting the linear regression line over the data
- Visualizing the cost function's surface and contours
